### Built with

- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- Mobile-first

### What I learned

I learnt how make a toggle, which is something I've never done before so that was a fun little challenge, which turned out not to be very difficult at all.

### Continued development

I'm starting to become really comfortable with some of the more simple parts of React development so looking forward to trying more and more difficult challenges.
